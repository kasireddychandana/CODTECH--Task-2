Python offers multiple options for developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, Tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with Tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create GUI applications. Creating a GUI using Tkinter is an easy task.

To create a Tkinter:

Importing the module – Tkinter
Create the main window (container)
Add any number of widgets to the main window
Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.

Code Explanation:

1. The code starts by creating a new tkinter window.

2. The title of the window is "MARKSHEET."

3. The geometry of the window is set to be 700×250 pixels.

4. Next, four objects are created: an entry object for holding data, an el object for holding student information, an e2 object for holding teacher information, and an e3 object for holding test information.

5. Each of these objects has a corresponding variable assigned to it.

6. For example, the entry object has a variable named el.

7. This variable stores the data entered into the window.

8. Similarly, each of the other objects also has a corresponding variable.

9. For example, the e2 object stores student information, and its corresponding variable is named s1.
11. The same goes for the other variables ineach of these objects.

12. Now that all of the variables have been initialized, some code is executed to create buttons and labels onscreen.

13. A button named btnStart is created and given a label of "Start."

14. A label called lblMarkName is also created and given a text value of "Mark Sheet."

15. Finally, two labels are created: one called lblStudentName and another called lbl TeacherName.

16. These labels will display

17. The code creates a new tkinter window and assigns it the title "MARKSHEET".

18. The geometry for the window is set to be 700×250.

19. Next, four objects are created which will be used to store data in the GUI.

20. These objects are named e1, e2, e3, and e4.

21. Finally, seven entries are created in each of these objects which will hold data about the students in the class.

22. The code starts by storing a variable, tot, to hold the total number of credits for each table.The next set of labels shows subject credits: Sub Credit, 4, 4, and 3.
These labels will show how many credit hours have been earned in each subject area.
Note that these values are rounded to two decimal places (e.g., Sub Credit = .5).
Finally, there are four labels for credit obtained: Credit obtained, 1/2 Credit obtained, 3/4 Credit obtained, and Full Credit obtained.
These labels will show how much credit has been earned in each subject area so far (rounded to two decimal places).
The code creates a grid with six rows and six columns.
The first row contains three labels: CS 201, CS 202, and MA 201.
The second row contains four labels: EC 201, Grade, Sub Credit, and Credit obtained.
The third row contains two labels: 4 and 3.
The fourth row contains one label: 4.
The fifth row contains one label: 3.
The sixth row has no labels.
The code also creates a grid with six rows and six columns that displays the grades for the subject credits in alphabetical order.
